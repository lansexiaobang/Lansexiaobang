1. The conditional correlation cannot fit the historical data perfectly

1). Adjust the bin size of the histogram: How to optimize the bin size? ANN?
2). Increase the historical data size by resampling? Whatâ€™s the name of the method?



2. How to distinguish the proposed one with ongoing ones in the literature?

1). Literature review of the scenario generation methods used for wind power bidding
2). Logicly state the features of these methods



3. How to strictly prove the method is convicing?
1) Test the marginal distribution first
2) Prove the asymetirc correlation comes from the joint correlation


4. P correlation cannot be used to estimate the conditonal correlation

1). its better to use spearman correlation, but how to convert it to equal probabilites?



5. Actual profits need to be explained more accurately

1) How the sysmetic correlation change the bidding strategy?
2) The significant level of price differences in DA and RT markets vs. profit improvement.
3) profit improvement under different price range.



6. Link the scenario generation and wind power bidding more closely.

1) propoerty of DA and RT electricity price joint distribution.
2) Futhure research for wind power and price correlation.
3) WP actually has a part of virtual bidding (the uncertainty cause by RT deviation).
